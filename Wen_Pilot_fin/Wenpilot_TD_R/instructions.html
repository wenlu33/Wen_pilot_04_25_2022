        General rules
    </h5>
        <p>
        There are 8 subjects participating in this experiment. </br>The experiment will be repeated for 7 rounds.
            </br> At the beginning of each round, you will be randomly and anonymously assigned with a subject. For example, at the beginning of the first round, 4 pairs will be formed randomly and anonymously and in next round, another different 4 pairs will be formed and so on. In each round, you and the other subjectâ€™s choices will determine the amount earned. The results of you and the other subject will be communicated at the end of each round. At the end of the experiment, the earnings of each participant will be determined as the sum of their earnings of the 7 rounds.
